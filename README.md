To use this script you'll need Tampermonkey: https://www.tampermonkey.net/

Edit the setTimeout value to be higher if needed.

Script will continue to call the function every 3000 ms due to React being used for the site only if the GLB option hasn't been selected.

Set downloadFile to true if you want to auto download files on page load after the GLB file has been selected.
