### Substance Asset Page Auto Select and Downloader
This script will auto select GLB files, while also allowing you to auto download assets.

### How to Use:
To use this script you'll need Tampermonkey: https://www.tampermonkey.net/

Edit the setTimeout value to be higher if needed.

Script will continue to call the function every 3000 ms due to React being used for the site only if the GLB option hasn't been selected.

UI will show up at the top of the page which will state the Auto Download condition, and allow the user to toggle it off or on.

### Notes:
If you enable auto download it will use up points when going to any asset page which you do not currently own. Disable this unless you're cycling through your owned assets.

### Future Release Plans:
I will be adding a full UI, along with an option to set your default file format, auto download, and auto download only owned assets.

I will also be adding more features on the material side.

There will be a filter feature to only show owned or un-owned assets.

Another feature will be to always download free assets so you can get those added to your library.
